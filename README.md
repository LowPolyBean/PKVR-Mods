# PKVR-Mods
A repository dedicated to my mods for Pokemod VR!
# PlayerBody Visibility
Simple, enable visibility of multiplayer playerbody.
issues may arise, if a bug occurs, please let me know via the issues tab!
(Yes, i am aware, there are bugs within the IK(inverse kinematics, the way the game calculates where to put your body parts). that is out of my control, unless i am to create my own separate IK system.)
# To-Do
- Hitbox Finetuning Mod.
improves colliders and triggers. simple changes, such as increasing grab box size, so that you can grab items easier, mon catch trigger size, to make catching easier from across the battle field, increasing wild battle trigger size, to make it easier to get into battle with a wild mon.
- Quest  mods with lemonloader?
need to test it out, may be possible, may not.
- if the developer decides to give us the framework to host our own server, i will absolutely begin work on creating custom mons and maybe even regions.
- Other QOL improvements. (bug fixes, movement updates, minor details to add immersion, etc.)
